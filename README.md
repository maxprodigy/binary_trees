# C - Binary trees

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of binary trees!
Cheers

At the end of this project, you'll undesrtand these questions:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that creates a binary tree node
1. Function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
2. Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
3. Function that deletes an entire binary tree
4. Function that checks if a node is a leaf
5. Function that checks if a given node is a root
6. Function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
7. Function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
8. Function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
9. Function that measures the height of a binary tree
10. Function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
11. Function that measures the size of a binary tree
12. Function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
13. Function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
14. Function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
15. Function that checks if a binary tree is full
16. Function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
17. Function that finds the sibling of a node
18. Function that finds the uncle of a node
